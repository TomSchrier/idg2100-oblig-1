I have decided to do task b) as it seemed like the most manageable as it also was used as an example during the lectures. In the code, four custom elements are components. An on-load function in the HTML initiates with reading the JSON and saved the values of the component object. When the JSON is read the render() function displays the component in the browser with the data.

Instructions
When the components display when opening the index file with Live Server enabled.
The "Refresh" button is to display children -> parent communication. When pressed, a message prints to the console. It displays how many times the button has been pressed (or "updated/refreshed" in our case).
